## myDailyJavaScriptCodingSolutions

Repository where I add solved by myself coding problem. 
One coding problem per day is the goal.
JavaScript code only. 

##### Task 1: 
    
<pre>Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
Bonus: Can you do this in one pass? </pre>

##### Task 2: 

<pre>Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example:
Given nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.</pre>
